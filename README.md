# StartEndML

Welcome to my Start to End ML Project!

My goal is to make the process of analyzing and selecting the best machine learning model for your dataset as easy and efficient as possible. With my website, you can input your dataset and let the system take care of the rest.

My website will automatically clean and preprocess your data, perform exploratory data analysis, and suggest the best machine learning models for your data along with their respective accuracies. This will save you time and effort in the data analysis process and help you make more informed decisions on which model to use for your project.

In the future, I also plan to incorporate explainable AI (XAI) to provide increased transparency and understanding of the model's decision-making process.

I hope you find this project helpful and user-friendly.
